## The Recipe Helper

Never forget another recipe!

Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties for
- title (a string),
- servings (a number),
- ingredients (an array of strings)
- steps (an array of strings)

Write a program to help you step through this recipe one step at a time, while you bake! We'll use alerts to make it go one step at a time through the steps of the recipe. 


As an example (copied from this recipe: https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies), the alerts could look like this:

 - alert `Are you ready to make The Best Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies?`
 - alert `Prepare the ingredients (see console for list)`
 - The console says:
   - `Ingredients:`
   - `1/2 cup granualted sugar`
   - `3/4 cup brown sugar`
   - `1/2 cup unsalted butter (115 g), melted`
   - `1 egg`
   - `1 teaspoon vanilla extract`
   - `1 and 1/4 cups of flour`
   - `200g chocolate chips`
 - alert `Are you ready to bake?`
 - alert `In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.`
 - alert `Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.`
 - alert `Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).`

Etc.

(Feel free to just use `console.log` instead of `alert` if the alerts get too much!)
