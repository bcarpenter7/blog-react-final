# GA Bank ATM App

### Summary
This lab will help you practice JavaScript functions and DOM manipulation. The picture above is just an idea of how you can display an account with a deposit and withdraw button, but feel free to go hardcore with the CSS. You can even make it look like an actual ATM!

### Specification:
* Keep track of account balance somewhere
* Add functionality so that a user can deposit money into the bank account.
* Make sure you are updating the display (DOM manipulation) so a user can see the change from depositing money.
* Add functionality so that a user can withdraw money from the bank account.
* Make sure you are updating the display (DOM manipulation) so a user can see the change from withdrawing money.
* Make sure the balance in an account can't go negative. If a user tries to
withdraw more money than exists in the account, ignore the transaction.
* When the balance of the bank account is $0 the background of that bank account
should be red. It should be gray when there is money in the account.

### Bonus:
* Feel free to add more features if you have time.
