### Lab: Valerie's Veggie Shop

Together we are going to look at our good friend Valerie's proposal for her
website. Valerie has been so gracious to provide us with what she wants to be
included on her website. Here are the steps we'll take to build her site:

1. Review the contents and map out our HTML structure, remember to be semantic.

1. Markup our [index.html](./index.html) file using semantic tags.

1. Add CSS styles to create a beautiful design using our semantic HTML. Be careful
   to follow the best practices outlined above.
