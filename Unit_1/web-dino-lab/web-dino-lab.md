# Web dinosaur

You travelled back in time a decade ago when there weren't a lot of frontend JS developer.
Developers around you were mostly backend developers with limited JS experience to write interactive websites.

You are now hired as a frontend JS developer and you need to make this dinosaur website interactive and dynamic.
Assume that the given html template is generated from the server where you are __NOT ABLE__ to modify the html content.
However, you are allowed to update the given JS `script.js` file and CSS `style.css` file.

Please complete the following tasks so you are getting paid enough money to quit your full-time job in the next few months and work on your revolutionary pet frontend framework project.

1. Add the dinosaur names below each silhouette (image)
1. When you click on a silhouette, it should change the information card to the right dinosaur information
1. Once a silhouette is selected, add stylings to the selected silhouette to indicate the selection
1. When the 'x' button is clicked, clear the selected dinosaur image and paragraph, and set the main heading to 'Please select a dinosaur'

Hint: you can use a data attribute to keep track of the selected dinosaur.

__Extension 1__

1. Add transition/animation to the content (image and paragraph) on showing/hiding
1. Add transition/animation to the content (image and paragraph) on transitioning from one selection to another

__Extension 2__

Make another page for a dinosaur game. It randomly picks a dinosaur silhouette and gives you 4 (also random) options to guess the name of the dinosaur (like a multi-choice quiz) and tells you whether you got it right or not.
