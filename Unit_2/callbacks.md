# What‚Äôs a Callback Function?

**Callback functions** are not a new type of function; they are defined just like any other function (as a declaration, expression, or arrow function).

**A callback function is a function being passed to another function as an argument.**

<aside>
üß† In programming, a function that accepts a function as an input or returns a function is called a *higher-order function*.

</aside>

Typically, the higher-order function accepts a callback to invoke it at least once.

Because you‚Äôve already used the array `forEach` method, which accepts a function as an argument, you‚Äôve already passed callback functions!

Although using **anonymous functions** as callbacks is convenient, it‚Äôs not uncommon to use a **named function** for code organization, for example:

```jsx
document.getElementById('todo-container')
  .addEventListener('click', handleTodoClick)
```

Or when the callback might be called from more than just one point in the code, for example:

```jsx
/*-- Event Listeners --*/
document.getElementById('replay-btn').addEventListener('click', init)

/*-- Functions --*/
init()

function init() {
  // Initialize state and call render
}
```

**Be careful not to invoke the callback when passing it** - in other words, do not put parens after it! Otherwise, you‚Äôll be passing the result returned by that function instead of the function itself.

## Review Questions ‚ùì

```jsx
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
	
colors.forEach(function(color, idx) {
  console.log(`${idx + 1} - ${color}`)
});
```

**Based upon the above code, answer the following:**

- What part of the code is the callback function?
- How many times will the higher-order function, `forEach`, invoke the callback?

# Why are Callbacks Needed?

Two scenarios require the use of callbacks:

1. As you‚Äôve already seen, functions/methods like `forEach` & `addEventListener` can only fulfill their purpose if they are provided a block of code - and callback functions provide that block of code.
2. As we‚Äôll see later in this lesson, JavaScript requires certain operations to execute *asynchronously*; that is, certain functions have to run in the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù while the rest of the program continues to execute. These asynchronous operations are often designed to accept a callback function that‚Äôs invoked when the background operation has been completed.

<aside>
üí° JavaScript‚Äôs asynchronous programming model is one of the more challenging concepts, so don‚Äôt despair if it takes a bit of time to understand.

## Practice Using Callbacks with Array Iterator Methods

One of the most popular use cases for callback functions is to provide them to iterator methods on arrays.

As we‚Äôve seen, calling the `forEach` method is a great way to iterate over all the elements in an array.

As you know, JavaScript has designed the `forEach` method to:

1. Accept a callback function as an argument, and
2. Invoke that callback once for each element in the array

## You do (15 minutes) üí™

1. Research the array [**filter**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method.
    
    <aside>
    üí° If the callback function returns a truthy value, the element for the current iteration will be included in the new array returned by the filter method.
    
    </aside>
    
2. Use the `filter` method to ‚Äúselect‚Äù the objects within the `cars` array that have been driven more than 20,000 miles per year:
    
    ```jsx
    const cars = [
      { make: 'Toyota', yrsOld: 5, mileage: 92399 },
      { make: 'Ford', yrsOld: 12, mileage: 255005 },
      { make: 'Ferrari', yrsOld: 9, mileage: 12966 },
      { make: 'Subaru', yrsOld: 9, mileage: 111266 },
      { make: 'Toyota', yrsOld: 2, mileage: 41888 },
      { make: 'Tesla', yrsOld: 3, mileage: 57720 }
    ]
    ```
    
    <aside>
    üí° Like forEach, the filter method will invoke the callback once for each element in the cars array. Note that each element is an object, so each time the callback is invoked, its parameter will hold an object with make, yrsOld & mileage properties.
    
    </aside>
    
3. Store the new array returned by `filter` in a variable named `wellDrivenCars`.
4. You may use either an anonymous or named function as the callback function provided to the `filter` method.
5. Use the `forEach` method on the `wellDrivenCars` array to `console.log` each ‚Äúcar‚Äù object.

We‚Äôll review a solution in 15 minutes.

# Using Callbacks with Asynchronous Functions

To understand what ‚Äúasynchronous‚Äù code means, let‚Äôs first confirm what **synchronous** code is.

## Synchronous Code Execution

So far, we‚Äôve taken for granted that the code we write runs line by line, and if we call a function/method, it finishes before the next line of code runs, i.e., it executes synchronously.

For example:

```jsx
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

console.log('Code BEFORE the forEach...')

colors.forEach(function(color, idx) {
  console.log(`${idx + 1} - ${color}`)
});

console.log('Code AFTER the forEach...')
```

Running the above results in this expected output:

```
Code BEFORE the forEach...
1 - red
2 - green
3 - blue
Code AFTER the forEach...
```

## Asynchronous Code Execution

By design, certain functions/methods in JavaScript run **asynchronously**.

When we invoke one of these asynchronous operations, they start doing their business in the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù while the rest of the code continues to run.

For example, let‚Äôs take a look at JavaScript‚Äôs `setTimeout` & `setInterval` functions, which, when called, wait in the background until the appropriate time to call the provided callback:

```jsx
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

console.log('Code BEFORE the forEach...')

// setTimeout accepts a callback & how long to wait before calling the cb
setTimeout(function() {
  colors.forEach(function(color, idx) {
    console.log(`${idx + 1} - ${color}`)
  })
}, 1000)  // 1000 milliseconds (1 sec)

console.log('Code AFTER the forEach...')
```

Running the above results in different output than the synchronous version:

```
Code BEFORE the forEach...
Code AFTER the forEach...
1 - red
2 - green
3 - blue
```

# **Why do Asynchronous Functions Exist?**

Asynchronous functions exist in JS for two reasons:

1. **By Design:**
    
    The `setTimeout` & `setInterval` allow us to run code after a certain amount of time expires (repeatedly as in the case of `setInterval`). Meanwhile, we want the rest of the program to continue to run, handle events, update the DOM, etc.
    
    Another example is the browser‚Äôs event system. As we‚Äôve seen, calling `addEventListener` starts listening for a certain event in the background while the rest of the program continues to execute.
    
2. **For Efficiency/Performance:**
    
    One day, we‚Äôll be calling functions to fetch data across the Internet or from a database. In computer terms, these operations take a crazy long time to complete - that‚Äôs why they are known as **long-running operations**. To avoid wasting valuable CPU cycles waiting for a long-running operation to finish, they are designed as asynchronous operations so that the rest of the program can do its thing.
    

# **Using Callbacks to Work with Asynchronous Code**

JavaScript provides two approaches to run a function **after** an asynchronous operation completes its long-running process or when an event such as a timeout occurs:

- **Callbacks**, and
- **Promises**

Which approach is determined by the function/method itself. For example, `forEach` & `setTimeout` require callbacks.

Later in the course, we‚Äôll encounter functions/methods designed to use promises or even both!

Let‚Äôs wrap up with some questions!

# Review Questions ‚ùì

1. **True or False: Callback functions are defined differently than non-callback functions.**
2. **If asked in a job interview, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a callback function?‚Äù - what would a good answer be?**
3. **Is the following code likely to work as expected?**
    
    ```jsx
    document.getElementById('items').addEventListener('click', handleClick())
    ```
    
4. **True or False: The `addEventListener` method is a *higher-order function*.**

## The Browser‚Äôs Event Loop

[**The Event Loop**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl0) - in this video, the amazing and funny Jake Archibald from Google does a fantastic job demonstrating the browser‚Äôs event loop.  asynchronous operations, such as event handlers, do their business and notify JavaScript when their work is done.

[Jake Archibald: In The Loop - JSConf.Asia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl0)

## **An Asynchronous Example**

The code below demonstrates how `setTimeout` and callback functions can be used to implement the scenario where we need to do something, wait for some time, do something else, wait for some time, etc.

Let‚Äôs say we wanted a traffic light to cycle between Red, Green, and Yellow lights, with each light being ‚Äúlit‚Äù for a differing amount of time:

- Red light on for 3 seconds
- Green light on for 2 seconds
- Yellow light on for 1 second

First, let‚Äôs copy/paste the HTML into **`index.html`**:

```html
<body>
  <!-- add the following HTML -->
  <main>
    <div id="red"></div>
    <div id="yellow"></div>
    <div id="green"></div>
  </main>
```

Now for some CSS (put this inside your `**style.css**` file):

```css
body {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

main {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 20vmin;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 20vmin);
  border: 2px solid grey;
}

main div {
  margin: 2vmin;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 2px solid grey;
}
```

<aside>
üö® Expect the following asynchronous code to be difficult to understand. However, the following example will come in handy if you choose to do a game like Simon that requires timing/sequencing.

</aside>

For the JavaScript, let‚Äôs start by defining a flexible data structure that makes it easy to modify the functionality (color and time):

```jsx
// Using a data-centric approach minimizes code and increases flexibility
const lightSequence = [
  {color: 'red', time: 3000},
  {color: 'yellow', time: 1000},
	{color: 'green', time: 2000},
]
```

Next, cache the light `<div>`s and define a variable to track the current light:

```jsx
// Cache the divs for the lights
const lightEls = document.querySelectorAll('main > div')

// Variable to track the current light
let curLightIdx = 2  // Start with green object
```

Now for the function responsible for displaying the current light and letting its caller know when the time has expired for the light:

```jsx
function renderLight(cb) {
  // Turn all lights off
  lightEls.forEach(el => el.style.backgroundColor = 'black')
  lightEls[curLightIdx].style.backgroundColor = lightSequence[curLightIdx].color
  // Invoke the callback when this light's time has expired
  setTimeout(cb, lightSequence[curLightIdx].time)
}
```

Finally, a function that increments the `curLightIdx` and calls `renderLight` while passing itself as a callback:

```jsx
function renderNextLight() {
  renderLight(renderNextLight)
  // Increment and reset to zero when 3 is reached
  curLightIdx === 0 ? curLightIdx = 2 : curLightIdx--
}

// Make it start!
renderNextLight()
```

Very cool!
